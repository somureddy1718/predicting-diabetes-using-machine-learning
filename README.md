# predicting-diabetes-using-machine-learning
Diabetes,is a group of metabolic disorders in which there is are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination,increased thirst,and increased hunger. If left untreated,diabetes can cause many complications.Acute complications can include diabetic Ketoacidosis,hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state or death.Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease,stroke,chronic kidney disease,foot ulcers,and damage the eyes.

OBJECTIVE:
We will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?
